# PolyEDM
We are building an experiment to search for the electron's <b>electric dipole moment</b> in laser-cooled and trapped polyatomic molecules.  These molecules offer robust systematic error rejection via internal co-magnetometer states, and provide a route to explore PeV-scale CP-violating physics.

Searches for the electron EDM depend on the ability to perform spin precession measurements with long interaction time and large numbers.  Both of these can be achieved with laser-cooled and trapped neutral polyatomic molecules, which also offer robust systematic error rejection techniques via internal co-magnetometer states.  The rapid advances in laser cooling of diatomic and polyatomic molecules have made such an experiment within reach, and will enable significant increases is sensitivity.  As an example, consider 106 heavy, eEDM-sensitive molecules in optical trap with 10 s coherence time.  After 1 week of integration, such an experiment will have sensitivity to CP-violating physics at the PeV scale.  This is beyond the reach of conceivable accelerators.  The ability to combine long coherence time, large numbers, internal co-magnetometers, and the ability to further enhance sensitivity via quantum control techniques is unique to polyatomic molecules.

The potential discovery of the EDM can provide answers to the inconsistencies that lie in the Standard Model and change the way we fundamentally do Physics forever.

# Program Description
In the Railgun folder, you will find my work done for simulation program that projects the trajectory of individual molecules travelling through a magnetized railgun. You can adjust the number of molecules travelling by varying the input parameter. Here, we want to analyze how varying magnetic field strengths can be used to forcibly funnel chaotic molecules into a narrow path.

In the Hamiltonian folder, you will find my work done for calculating the hamiltonian energy level of individual molecules that are travelling through a molecular beam slower.
Here we wanted to calculate the total excitation level of individual molecules in order to determine the strength of the cooling beam.

# Running the Program
In the <b>Beam Slowing</b> and <b>Hamiltonian</b> folders, simply type

python3 main.py in either folder in order to calculate the magnetic field strength and hamiltonian energy levels of super cooled molecules. You should obtain the following plots as shown below.
